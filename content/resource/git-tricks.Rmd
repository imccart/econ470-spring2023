Below are some of the more common things we'll do this semester with Git and GitHub (aside from your standard commit, push, and pull)

### Clone a repository and set as your own
1. Clone repository to desktop or AWS
2. Create your own repository in GitHub
3. Remove remote, `git remote rm origin`
4. Set new remote `git remote add origin NEW_URL` (where NEW_URL is your own repository)
5. git push origin HEAD:master
6. git push --set-upstream origin master
