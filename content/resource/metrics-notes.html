<p>Lots of faculty put their econometrics lectures and notes online for the world. Below is a list of several that Iâ€™ve found to be particularly useful (in addition to the free online textbooks already used in the class)</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/miguel-hernan/causal-inference-book/">Causal Inference Book</a> by Jamie Robin and Miguel Hernan</li>
<li><a href="https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~bhansen/econometrics/">Econometrics</a> by Bruce Hansen</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/NickCH-K/econometrics">Introductory Econometrics</a> class notes from Nick Huntington-Klein</li>
<li><a href="http://www.carolinacaetano.net/">Econometrics Notes</a> from Carolina Caetano at UGA</li>
<li>Ever wish you had a central resource for lots of little commands and how to do things in different stats packages? Nick Huntington-Klein thought the same thing in his <a href="https://lost-stats.github.io/">Library of Statistical Techniques (LOST)</a>.</li>
</ul>
