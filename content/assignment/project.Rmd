# Instructions
For the main project, you will write a 5-page policy brief and discuss your policy among the class. **Check back soon for details on the format of the policy brief and the grading rubric.**


# Policy Topics
Below are some potential policy questions you may consider that closely align with areas we've covered in the class; however, you are not restricted to select from this list. You are free to pursue other questions that may be of more interest to you. Please inform me of your intended area of interest no later than **March 15, 2023**. 

## Hospital Pricing. 
This topic uses the [HCRIS Repo](https://github.com/imccart/HCRIS).

1. What is the effect of hospital profit status on hospital prices? 

Data on hospital for-profit versus not-for-profit status is available from the Provider of Services files, which I will provide for anyone interested. The data are publicly available, but I have the data already clean so I'll spare you some extra work here!
 
2. How did Medicaid expansion affect hospital "bad debt"?

Data on Medicaid expansion are available from the Kaiser Family Foundation, which is part of the [ACS and Medicaid Expansion Repo](https://github.com/imccart/Insurance-Access). You will also need to find "bad debt" in the hospital cost reports and edit the code file accordingly.


## Demand for Cigarettes. 
This topic uses the [CDC Tax Burden on Tobacco Repo](https://github.com/imccart/CDC-Tobacco).

3. How do smoking regulations affect cigarette demand?

Data on smoking laws (such as clean indoor air laws) are available from the State Tobacco Activities Tracking and Evaluation System: [CDC smoking regulations link](https://www.cdc.gov/statesystem/index.html).

4. What is the effect of smoking on obesity?

Data on obesity rates at the state level are avalable from the CDC Overweight and Obesity datasets: [CDC obesity link](https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/index.html).


## Medicare Advantage. 
This topic uses the [Medicare Advantage Repo](https://github.com/imccart/Medicare-Advantage)

5. Did the quality improvement program increase quality?

Details of the MA quality improvement program can be found [here](https://www.gao.gov/assets/590/589473.pdf).

6. Do higher-rated contracts charge higher premiums?

This can be answered using the existing Medicare Advantage repo. While this project doesn't require any additional data collection, it is a challenging exercise and will take additional time to understand the nature of Medicare Advantage premiums. Total time is comparable to other topics.

## Medicaid Expansion. 
This topic uses the [ACS and Medicaid Expansion Repo](https://github.com/imccart/Insurance-Access).

7. Does health insurance improve health?

Data on health trends at different geographic levels is available from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System: [BRFSS data link](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/data_tools.htm).

8. Does Medicaid crowd-out private health insurance?

This can be answered using the existing ACS and Medicaid Expansion repo. While this project doesn't require any additional data collection, it is a challenging exercise and will take additional time to understand the nature of the Medicaid and private health insurance markets. Total time is comparable to other topics.
