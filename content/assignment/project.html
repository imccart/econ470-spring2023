<div id="hospital-pricing." class="section level2">
<h2>Hospital Pricing.</h2>
<p>This topic uses the <a href="https://github.com/imccart/HCRIS">HCRIS Repo</a>.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What is the effect of hospital profit status on hospital prices?</li>
</ol>
<p>Data on hospital for-profit versus not-for-profit status is available from the Provider of Services files, which I will provide for anyone interested. The data are publicly available, but I have the data already clean so I’ll spare you some extra work here!</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>How did Medicaid expansion affect hospital “bad debt”?</li>
</ol>
<p>Data on Medicaid expansion are available from the Kaiser Family Foundation, which is part of the <a href="https://github.com/imccart/Insurance-Access">ACS and Medicaid Expansion Repo</a>. You will also need to find “bad debt” in the hospital cost reports and edit the code file accordingly.</p>
</div>
<div id="demand-for-cigarettes." class="section level2">
<h2>Demand for Cigarettes.</h2>
<p>This topic uses the <a href="https://github.com/imccart/CDC-Tobacco">CDC Tax Burden on Tobacco Repo</a>.</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>How do smoking regulations affect cigarette demand?</li>
</ol>
<p>Data on smoking laws (such as clean indoor air laws) are available from the State Tobacco Activities Tracking and Evaluation System: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/statesystem/index.html">CDC smoking regulations link</a>.</p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What is the effect of smoking on obesity?</li>
</ol>
<p>Data on obesity rates at the state level are avalable from the CDC Overweight and Obesity datasets: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/index.html">CDC obesity link</a>.</p>

<div id="medicare-advantage." class="section level2">
<h2>Medicare Advantage.</h2>

<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Did the quality improvement program increase quality?</li>
</ol>
<p>Details of the MA quality improvement program can be found <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/590/589473.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<ol start="6" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Do higher-rated contracts charge higher premiums?</li>
</ol>
<p>This can be answered using the existing Medicare Advantage repo. While this project doesn’t require any additional data collection, it is a challenging exercise and will take additional time to understand the nature of Medicare Advantage premiums. Total time is comparable to other topics.</p>
</div>
<div id="medicaid-expansion." class="section level2">
<h2>Medicaid Expansion.</h2>
<p>This topic uses the <a href="https://github.com/imccart/Insurance-Access">ACS and Medicaid Expansion Repo</a>.</p>

<ol start="8" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Does Medicaid crowd-out private health insurance?</li>
</ol>
<p>This can be answered using the existing ACS and Medicaid Expansion repo. While this project doesn’t require any additional data collection, it is a challenging exercise and will take additional time to understand the nature of the Medicaid and private health insurance markets. Total time is comparable to other topics.</p>
