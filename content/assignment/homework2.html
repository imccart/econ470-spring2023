<h1>Instructions</h1>
<p>In this assignment, you’ll recreate the HCRIS data and answer a few questions along the way. The first step is to make sure you’re working with the <a href="https://github.com/imccart/hcris-class">HCRIS GitHub repository</a> and downloaded all of the raw data sources. Once you have the data downloaded and the code running, answer the following questions:</p>
</div>
<div id="summarize-the-data" class="section level1">
<h1>Summarize the data</h1>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>How many hospitals filed more than one report in the same year? Show your answer as a line graph of the number of hospitals over time.</p></li>
<li><p>After removing/combining multiple reports, how many unique hospital IDs (Medicare provider numbers) exist in the data?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the distribution of total charges (tot_charges in the data) in each year? Show your results with a “violin” plot, with charges on the y-axis and years on the x-axis. For a nice tutorial on violin plots, look at <a href="https://ggplot2tutor.com/powerlifting/squats/">Violin Plots with ggplot2</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>What is the distribution of estimated prices in each year? Again present your results with a violin plot, and recall our formula for estimating prices from class.</p></li>
</ol>
<pre class="r"><code>discount_factor = 1-tot_discounts/tot_charges
price_num = (ip_charges + icu_charges + ancillary_charges)*discount_factor - tot_mcare_payment
price_denom = tot_discharges - mcare_discharges
price = price_num/price_denom</code></pre>

<h1>Estimate ATEs</h1>
<p>For the rest of the assignment, you should include only observations in 2012. So we are now dealing with cross-sectional data in which some hospitals are penalized and some are not. Please also define <strong>penalty</strong> as whether the sum of the HRRP and HVBP amounts are negative (i.e., a net penalty under the two programs). Code to do this is in the Section 2 slides. <br></p>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Calculate the average price among penalized versus non-penalized hospitals.</p></li>
<li><p>Split hospitals into quartiles based on bed size. To do this, create 4 new indicator variables, where each variable is set to 1 if the hospital’s bed size falls into the relevant quartile. Provide a table of the average price among treated/control groups for each quartile.</p></li>
<li><p>Find the average treatment effect using each of the following estimators, and present your results in a single table:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nearest neighbor matching (1-to-1) with inverse variance distance based on quartiles of bed size</li>
<li>Nearest neighbor matching (1-to-1) with Mahalanobis distance based on quartiles of bed size</li>
<li>Inverse propensity weighting, where the propensity scores are based on quartiles of bed size</li>
<li>Simple linear regression, adjusting for quartiles of bed size using dummy variables and appropriate interactions as discussed in class</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>With these different treatment effect estimators, are the results similar, identical, very different?</p></li>
<li><p>Do you think you’ve estimated a causal effect of the penalty? Why or why not? (just a couple of sentences)</p></li>
<li><p>Briefly describe your experience working with these data (just a few sentences). Tell me one thing you learned and one thing that really aggravated you.</p></li>
