<h1>Instructions</h1>
<p>In this assignment, you’ll recreate the HCRIS data and answer a few questions along the way. The first step is to make sure you’re working with the <a href="https://github.com/imccart-test/hcris">HCRIS GitHub repository</a> and downloaded all of the raw data sources. Once you have the data downloaded and the code running, answer the following questions:</p>
</div>
<div id="summarize-the-data" class="section level1">
<h1>Summarize the data</h1>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>How many hospitals submitted the 1996 version of the HCRIS reports in 2010? How is that even possible?</li>
<li>How many hospitals filed more than one report in the same year? Show your answer as a line graph of the number of hospitals over time.</li>
<li>After removing/combining multiple reports, how many unique hospital IDs (Medicare provider numbers) exist in the data? Provide a line graph plotting the number of hospitals in each year.</li>
<li>What is the distribution of total charges (<code>tot_charges</code> in the data) in each year? Show your results with a “violin” plot, with charges on the y-axis and years on the x-asix. For a nice tutorial on violin plots, look at <a href="https://ggplot2tutor.com/powerlifting/squats/">Violin Plots with ggplot2</a>.</li>
<li>Create the same violin plot with estimated prices on the y-axis. Recall our formula for estimating prices from class.</li>
</ol>
<pre class="r"><code>discount_factor = 1-tot_discounts/tot_charges
price_num = (ip_charges + icu_charges + ancillary_charges)*discount_factor - tot_mcare_payment
price_denom = tot_discharges - mcare_discharges
price = price_num/price_denom</code></pre>
<ol start="6" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Form an indicator variable set to 1 if the hospital incurred a penalty under the readmission reduction program. Plot the share of hospitals penalized in each year.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="estimate-ates" class="section level1">
<h1>Estimate ATEs</h1>
<p>For the rest of the assignment, you should include only observations in 2012. So we are now dealing with cross-sectional data in which some hospitals are penalized and some are not. Please also define <strong>penalty</strong> as whether the sum of the HRRP and HVBP amounts are negative (i.e., a net penalty under the two programs). Code to do this is in the Section 2 slides. <br></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Calculate the average price among penalized versus non-penalized hospitals.</p></li>
<li><p>Split hospitals into quartiles based on bed size. To do this, create 4 new indicator variables, where each variable is set to 1 if the hospital’s bed size falls into the relevant quartile.</p></li>
<li><p>Find the average treatment effect using nearest neighbor matching (1-to-1) with inverse variance distance based on quartiles of bed size.</p></li>
<li><p>Find the average treatment effect using nearest neighbor matching (1-to-1) with Mahalanobis distance based on quartiles of bed size.</p></li>
<li><p>Find the average treatment effect using inverse propensity weighting, where the propensity scores are based on quartiles of bed size.</p></li>
<li><p>Find the average treatment effect using a single linear regression.</p></li>
<li><p>With these different treatment effect estimators, are the results similar, identical, very different?</p></li>
<li><p>Do you think you’ve estimated a causal effect of the penalty? Why or why not? (just a couple of sentences)</p></li>
</ol>
