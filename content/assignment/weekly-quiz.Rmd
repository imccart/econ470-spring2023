There will be one "quiz" per week. The quizzes will be very short and very easy. The goal of the quiz is really just to see who is attending and who is engaged. 

Completing the quiz is worth **1 point** toward your participation grade for that week. The quizzes will typically take place in class but may be done online if needed.

**UPDATE:** Due to absences from COVID isolation, these weekly quizzes don't really make much sense. The participation grade will therefore only be based off of the weekly check-ins this semester. In order to keep things consistent with the original point structure, everyone will receive an automatic 5 points for the in-class quiz component. That leaves 10 additional participation points to be earned via the weekly check-ins on Canvas.
