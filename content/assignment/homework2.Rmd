# Instructions
In this assignment, you'll recreate the HCRIS data and answer a few questions along the way. The first step is to make sure you're working with the [HCRIS GitHub repository](https://github.com/imccart-test/hcris) and downloaded all of the raw data sources. Once you have the data downloaded and the code running, answer the following questions:

# Summarize the data
1. How many hospitals submitted the 1996 version of the HCRIS reports in 2010? How is that even possible?
2. How many hospitals filed more than one report in the same year? Show your answer as a line graph of the number of hospitals over time.
3. After removing/combining multiple reports, how many unique hospital IDs (Medicare provider numbers) exist in the data? Provide a line graph plotting the number of hospitals in each year.
4. What is the distribution of total charges (`tot_charges` in the data) in each year? Show your results with a "violin" plot, with charges on the y-axis and years on the x-asix. For a nice tutorial on violin plots, look at [Violin Plots with ggplot2](https://ggplot2tutor.com/powerlifting/squats/).
5. Create the same violin plot with estimated prices on the y-axis. Recall our formula for estimating prices from class.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
discount_factor = 1-tot_discounts/tot_charges
price_num = (ip_charges + icu_charges + ancillary_charges)*discount_factor - tot_mcare_payment
price_denom = tot_discharges - mcare_discharges
price = price_num/price_denom
```
6. Form an indicator variable set to 1 if the hospital incurred a penalty under the readmission reduction program. Plot the share of hospitals penalized in each year.


# Estimate ATEs
For the rest of the assignment, you should include only observations in 2012. So we are now dealing with cross-sectional data in which some hospitals are penalized and some are not. Please also define **penalty** as whether the sum of the HRRP and HVBP amounts are negative (i.e., a net penalty under the two programs). Code to do this is in the Section 2 slides. <br>

1. Calculate the average price among penalized versus non-penalized hospitals. 

2. Split hospitals into quartiles based on bed size. To do this, create 4 new indicator variables, where each variable is set to 1 if the hospital's bed size falls into the relevant quartile. 

3. Find the average treatment effect using nearest neighbor matching (1-to-1) with inverse variance distance based on quartiles of bed size. 

4. Find the average treatment effect using nearest neighbor matching (1-to-1) with Mahalanobis distance based on quartiles of bed size.

5. Find the average treatment effect using inverse propensity weighting, where the propensity scores are based on quartiles of bed size.

6. Find the average treatment effect using a single linear regression.

7. With these different treatment effect estimators, are the results similar, identical, very different? 

8. Do you think you've estimated a causal effect of the penalty? Why or why not? (just a couple of sentences)
