Part 1 of this module will introduce the confusing mess that is hospital prices and the data we'll use to measure them.

## Objectives
- Understand the nature of hospital pricing
- Compare and contrast different measures of hospital "prices" used in popular media


## Activities 
- Clone [Hospital Cost Report Information System (HCRIS)](https://github.com/imccart-test/hcris) repository and begin working with data. See also a similar repository [here](https://github.com/asacarny/hospital-cost-reports) from [Adam Sacarny](http://sacarny.com/)
