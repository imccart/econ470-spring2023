This introduction module is a time for us to: 1) discuss the course; 2) get set up for future data work; and 3) learn/refresh some basic data management and analysis skills using R, Git, and GitHub. We'll also introduce the idea of causal inference and define the treatment effect estimands that will be of central interest throughout the course.
