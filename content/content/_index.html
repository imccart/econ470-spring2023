<p>The class content is organized around five modules. Each module has a set of presentation slides, and on each class session page you’ll see buttons for opening the presentation in a new tab or for downloading a PDF of the slides in case you want to print them or store them on your computer:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<span class="btn btn-primary btn-lg"><i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i> View all slides in new window</span> <span class="btn btn-primary btn-lg"><i class="far fa-file-pdf"></i> Download PDF of all slides</span>
</p>
<p>We’ll spend three to four weeks on each module. For every week, there are slides and specific objectives/activities for the week. These slides and objectives are listed as part of each module and are available on the navigation pane.</p>
