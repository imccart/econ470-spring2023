<p>Part 2 begins our first attempt to estimate a causal treatment effect. We’ll do so with a few approaches, all of which rely on the combination of a “selection on observables” or “conditional independence” assumption, along with a “common support” assumption.</p>
<div id="objectives" class="section level2">
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<ul>
<li>Understand and explain the differences between matching and re-weighting</li>
<li>Explain the implicit weighting in OLS regression and how to avoid such weighting</li>
<li>Calculate an ATE or ATT using regression, matching, and weighting</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="activities" class="section level2">
<h2>Activities</h2>
<ul>
<li>Continue working with the <a href="https://github.com/imccart-test/hcris">Hospital Cost Report Information System (HCRIS)</a> repository.</li>
<li>Estimate treatment effects with simulated data, using matching, regression, and re-weighting</li>
</ul>
